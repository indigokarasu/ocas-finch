# Session 2026-06-29 — finch:work Cascading Dependency Skip

## Problem

finch:work ran with 12 pending tasks. The top-priority task (task_019, critical) was OAuth revocation. The next 5 high-priority tasks were all email-dependent (follow up on COC, RSVP to event, clay pickup email, <employer> tracking, AlphaSights response). All would fail because OAuth was dead.

Naive approach: evaluate each task one-by-one, attempt execution, discover OAuth block, move to next. This wastes 5-8 tool calls per blocked task.

## Solution

Recognized the cascading dependency pattern:
1. Identified task_019 as an infrastructure-level blocker (OAuth)
2. Mapped the dependency: OAuth → all Gmail/email/Drive tasks
3. Skipped the entire cluster of 6+ dependent tasks in one decision
4. Found task_014 (cron provider error monitoring) — only needed `hermes cron list`, no Gmail
5. Executed task_014, confirmed both monitored jobs had recovered, marked done

## Outcome

- task_014: marked DONE (haiku:morning-scan + taste:scan both recovered, last run OK)
- task_019: updated timestamp, still pending (OAuth)
- 6+ email tasks: correctly skipped without individual evaluation
- Total tool calls saved: ~15-20 vs naive per-task iteration

## Pattern Name

**Cascading dependency awareness** — when a critical infrastructure dependency fails, skip the entire dependent cluster before per-task evaluation.

## Key Insight

The actionability filter's 4 conditions (no external response, no business decision, no auth, no user input) are per-task checks. Cascading dependency awareness is a PRE-FILTER that eliminates entire clusters before per-task evaluation. It's the difference between "check each task against the filter" and "recognize that all tasks in this cluster share the same blocker."

## Confirmed
